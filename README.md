# HealthSensO

## Description

HealthSensO is a web application that allows users to track their health goals. Users can create an account and log their daily food intake, including calories, carbs, proteins, fats, etc. There is also a servings counter page on which the user can keep track of their daily intake of water, vegetables, fruits, grains, meats, dairy, oils, and sweets.
Users can also search for recipes based on their dietary needs and preferences, as well as save recipes to their profile. Users can also view their daily nutritional profile and goals reached in their log book.
